# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue in Custom View

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera preview fails to render correctly when used within a custom view. The preview may show a black screen or a distorted image, especially within complex UI layouts.  The issue is intermittent and not easily reproducible in simple setups.

## Bug Report

The bug is described in detail in the `bug.js` file.  The file demonstrates the problem within a custom view setup using React Native components.  The `bugSolution.js` file (if available) provides potential solutions.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
4. Observe the camera preview within the app; it should exhibit rendering issues as described.

## Potential Solutions (if available)

See the `bugSolution.js` file for potential workarounds and solutions.  This includes adjustments to the camera's styling, layout hierarchy, and possibly the usage of specific React Native components.

## Additional Notes

This issue may be related to asynchronous rendering, timing problems within the React Native lifecycle, or interactions between the Expo Camera API and other UI components.  Providing solutions is essential to help others facing the same problem.
